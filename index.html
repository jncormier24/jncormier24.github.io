				<section id="mainstay">
					<h1 class="header1">Mainstay Technologies <span class="time">2013 - Present</span></h1>
					<p>My time spent at Mainstay has been one of evolution. Most of my professional career has been spent there, and I've grown from a Junior Developer to Senior Developer in that time. Our project work ranged from small website construction using Wordpress or even Wix, to very large, complex appliction design and maintenance. In our most recent project, which is ongoing, I am the Architect. I created the object design, the database schema, application structure and flow, I chose the tools and the standards. I also set up the deployment process. As the project progresses I am the code reviewer, and ultimately the product champion. For this project I chose Laravel for the backend, Vue.js for the front end, and Bulma for a style framework.</p>
					<p>Development has not been the only role I've had a Mainstay. Throughout my time I've been the main support engineer for our website hosting, including 3 full server migrations. Most recently I was tasked with finding a new hosting company, setting up our hosting agreement, creating the hosting environments including 3 virtual machines initially and a firewall, testing all of our hosted applications and sites on the new platform, and migrating most of them. I have also taken on the responsibilties of development for our operations, which has me developing solutions in Powershell and SQL, and researching new automation tools that we can leverage.</p>

					<h1 class="header1">Plymouth State University - MIS <span class="time">2012 - 2013</span></h1>
					<p>While I was a student at Plymouth I was also given the opportunity to work for the Managed Information Services team my Senior (5th) year. Working on this team gave me the opportunity to see a properly structure PHP framework, and get my feet wet with both industry standard tools, and a sensible code review process. At MIS I learned how to work with a development team to solve problems, and was given great direction on how to solve particular challenges that can plague the web.</p>

					<h1 class="header1">Fidelity Investments - Technical Intern <span class="time">2012</span></h1>
					<p>My summer at Fidelity was spent in two parts. The first half of the internship was spent working to update their tomcat servers to a newer version. This process had me working with a Senior developer for guidence and the eventual update.</p>
					<p>The second half of the internship I spent researching and creating a proff of concept for a new front end for an existing application. During this project I learning about RESt/General API use, Asynchronus calls to those APIs, and UX presentation. This project was done mostly with Javascript/jQuery.</p>

				<section id="debris">
					<h1 class="header1">Debris Publishing <span class="time">2012</span></h1>
					<p>At Debris I worked on a project that had me working both on the web and for iOS. My project was to develop a financial calculator that the owner was devising as we were building it. My experience here was setting up a development/hosting server, working with PHP and Javascript, and later on working in XCode and with Objective-C and the iOS SDK.</p>

				<h2 class="header2">Interests</h2>
				<p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my Girlfriend and our Holland Lop Rabbit Loop. I am an avid Boston Sports fan and enjoy catching a game when I can. I enjoy learning as much as possible, whether it's new technologies or a new piece of music on guitar I am always thinking about what's coming up next.</p>
